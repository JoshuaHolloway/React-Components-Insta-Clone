### Task 2a: MVP

- [ ]  This app can be broken down to two main sections that you'll need to implement for this project: the Search Bar and the Posts.
- [ ]  To complete this project there will be a single instance of the Search Bar being rendered at the top of the page, as well as a Posts component that renders an individual Post for every object inside the `dummy-data.js` array.
- [ ]  Use what you learned yesterday to set up state to keep track of the posts.

- [ ]  You will implement a callback to increase the "likes count" on posts, and hand it through props several levels down into a nested component.
- [ ]  Look through the code before you start. There are a lot of files. Not all of them need code added to them. Start in the App.js file and read the instructions there.
